Medical Chatbot Development Flow
=================================

1. Project Setup
   - Created virtual environment (venv)
   - Set up requirements.txt
   - Configured setup.py for package installation

2. Configuration & Environment
   - Created src/config.py for centralized configuration management
   - Set up .env for API keys (Pinecone, Gemini)
   - Configured Pinecone index settings (dimension: 384, metric: cosine)

3. Data Processing Pipeline
   - Built src/helper.py with PDF loading, text splitting, and embeddings
   - Created store_index.py to process medical documents and create vector store
   - Implemented document chunking (500 chars, 20 overlap)

4. LLM & Retrieval Setup
   - Created src/prompt.py with medical assistant system prompt
   - Integrated Google Gemini LLM (gemini-2.5-flash, temp: 0.3)
   - Set up RAG chain with retriever (k=3, similarity search)

5. Query Classification
   - Built src/utility.py with QueryClassifier class
   - Implemented pattern matching for greetings/simple queries
   - Added medical keyword detection to avoid unnecessary retrieval

6. Streaming Implementation
   - Created StreamingHandler class in src/utility.py
   - Implemented async token streaming from RAG chain
   - Added character-by-character streaming for simple responses

7. FastAPI Application
   - Built app.py with FastAPI routes (GET /, POST /get)
   - Integrated query classification → streaming → memory flow
   - Added session management with UUID for each page load

8. Conversation Memory
   - Implemented session-based chat history storage
   - Added conversation buffer (last 5 pairs = 10 messages)
   - Created auto-cleanup on page reload to prevent memory leaks

9. Frontend UI
   - Created templates/index.html with Tailwind CSS
   - Designed clean, minimal chatbot interface
   - Implemented real-time streaming
   - Added SSE (Server-Sent Events) handling for token streaming

10. Deployment Preparation
    - Created Dockerfile for containerization
    - Set up docker-compose.yml for easy deployment
    - Built .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml for GitHub Actions
    - Created  README.md
    - Configured .gitignore and .dockerignore
